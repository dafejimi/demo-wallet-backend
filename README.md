1. **Users**: Stores user information and credentials.
2. **Wallets**: Manages wallet data, linked to specific users.
3. **Transactions**: Logs all transaction records, linked to specific wallets.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that provides static typing.
- **Knex.js**: SQL query builder for interacting with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing user, wallet, and transaction data.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertions for integration testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **MySQL** (>=8.x)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lendsqr-wallet-service.git
   cd lendsqr-wallet-service
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=your_preferred_port
   ```

4. **Database Migration**

   Run Knex migrations to set up the database tables:

   ```bash
   npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile src/config/database.ts
   ```

5. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:<PORT>`
